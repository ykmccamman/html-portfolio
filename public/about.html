<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is KaiLi McCamman and I am 29 years old. I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri in the United States. I have always loved traveling, so I deceided to take my dog, Pebbles and travel the world. </p>

<p>We lived in Spain for two years and are now currently living in Thailand. My goal is to live in all continents by the time I am 35 years of age. I am an English and Science teacher, so my job allows me to anywhere.</p>

<p>However, teaching isn't the career I would like to be in for the rest of my life, so I am learning web deveopment as a new skill. I hope to gain more knowledge with this and branch into a new field that better suits what I am looking for in my lifetime career.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my portfolio. If you would like to contact me, please do so by clicking the "Contact Me" link. Thanks so much! </p>
